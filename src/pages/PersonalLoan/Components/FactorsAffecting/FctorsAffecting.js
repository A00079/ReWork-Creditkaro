                                    Your income is the foremost deciding factor for your personal loan application. The greater your income, the higher your chances of being assigned lower personal loan interest rates. The bank needs to determine how easily you can repay the loan amount. To provide customers with a personal loan, the bank needs to trust them. This can only be possible when their income is above a certain minimum value.

The credit score is a 3-digit numeric rank provided by the Credit Rating Agency to individuals based on their credit repayment history. A good credit score is an indication that you can manage the loan well and repay in time.</p>
